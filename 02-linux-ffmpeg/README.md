[中文版](README_zh_CN.md)

### 1. Vibe Learning Web Search Keywords (Google, YouTube, or AI)

- How to create a GitHub account
- How to use GitHub Codespaces
- What is markdown format text
- What is TTS (Text-to-Speech)?
- How to use FFmpeg video editing software

### 2. Free Text, Audio, and Video Generation Websites

- Text: https://chat.minimax.io/
- Audio: https://www.minimax.io/audio/text-to-speech
- Video: https://hailuoai.video/create

### 3. AI Prompt – Creating Text and Image AI Prompts for eBook Videos

I need to create a children's eBook with the theme: "The Kitten Learns to Fly."

Please follow the markdown format between """ and """ below:

```markdown
"""
# Cover: eBook Title

## Scene-1: Scene Title

### Scene-1 Text

Scene-1 text for generating audio through TTS, approximately 30 words.

### Scene-1 Image

Scene-1 image AI prompt for generating an image using AI.

## Scene-n: Scene Title

Scene-n text for generating audio through TTS, approximately 30 words.

### Scene-n Image

Scene-n image AI prompt for generating an image using AI.
"""
```

Generate eBook text and image AI prompts for 5 scenes following the above format.


### 4. AI Prompt – Generate a Shell Script using FFmpeg for eBook Video Creation

I have five images, each paired with an MP3 audio file. Generate a Linux shell script using FFmpeg to create an eBook video.


### 5. AI Prompt – User Manual and Test & Acceptance Procedure

Write a user manual and testing procedure for this shell script to ensure it works reliably in various situations:

1. Different Linux distributions and environments
2. Different shell environments
3. Considering different FFmpeg versions
4. Error handling


### 6. Ask AI to Summarize Completed Work

Briefly summarize the Linux shell script according to the following points (only applicable points):

1. **Project Requirements:** High-level overview including goals, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.
2. **Application Flow and Diagram:** Step-by-step mapping of the user journey and system interactions, accompanied by clear flow diagrams.
3. **Technical Stack Overview:** Explanation of technical choices (language, frameworks, libraries, cloud services, tools) and version details.
4. **Frontend and Backend Guide:** Coding standards, architectural patterns, folder structures, API protocol conventions, testing strategies, and style guidelines for client-side and server-side respectively.
5. **APIs, SDKs, and Technical References:** Integration of all external dependencies: third-party APIs, SDKs, libraries, and platforms, including endpoints, version numbers, configuration examples, and quick-start guides.



### 7. Ask AI to List Key Learning Points for Vibe Learning

I'm currently learning how to use AI for Vibe Coding through Vibe Learning. Below is an introduction to these concepts:

- **Vibe Coding:** A completely new coding method allowing users without any coding background to complete a full programming project using AI.
- **Vibe Learning:** Focusing on mastering fundamental professional knowledge, avoiding complex details, and clearly prompting AI to perform development tasks, enabling those with no coding skills to develop projects.

My current professional knowledge background:

- Basic Windows usage skills only
- Basic understanding of AI
- Just started using GitHub
- Just started using Linux
- No coding knowledge at all
- Unfamiliar with what programming languages are

To instruct AI to write shell scripts in Linux, following Vibe Learning and Vibe Coding principles, list the basic knowledge points I need to learn to:

- Give AI development instructions using professional language
- Communicate professionally with AI during development
- Assist AI in manual tasks outside of coding
- Check and test AI-completed tasks and identify or raise issues

Then, I can easily use AI to complete this project.
