### AI Prompts

#### 1. Using AI for Vibe Coding

Create an AI video generation project using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- Integrate OpenAI's text, TTS, and image generation capabilities
- Achieve automated creation of audiobook-style videos
- Generated videos consist of multiple scenes, each containing text and corresponding narration
- Content is dynamically generated based on user-provided prompts, such as children's stories, ancient poetry, English learning materials, or other educational topics

The final project must be presented as a webpage: users enter prompts on the webpage, the system automatically displays generation progress, and upon completion, users can directly play the generated video on the webpage.

Provide all project file names, directory structure, and complete source code.

### 2. AI Prompt for Business Analysis

You are a senior business analyst and technical architect.

I will provide you with a brief project requirement. Your job is to analyze and summarize it in detail to help me understand the project before development begins.

Your response should include:

1. A clear **Business Summary**.
2. Identification of **Key Elements**:
   - Stakeholders
   - Inputs
   - Process Steps
   - Outputs
   - Business Objectives
   - Risks
3. A list of well-written **User Stories** (using the format “As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [reason]”).
4. A breakdown of:
   - **Functional Requirements** (features the system must have)
   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (performance, security, scalability, etc.)
5. Clearly defined **Acceptance Criteria** for the major requirements.
6. A **Technology Stack Overview** (recommend suitable languages, frameworks, databases, services).
7. A **Mermaid.js Flowchart** that visualizes the business or system process flow.
8. Brief **Explanation of the Flowchart**.

Use the following format in your response:

**Business Summary:**
(Overview of the project problem or opportunity)

**Key Elements:**
- **Stakeholders:**
- **Inputs:**
- **Process Steps:**
- **Outputs:**
- **Objectives:**
- **Risks:**

**User Stories:**
- (Example: As a customer, I want to receive email updates, so that I stay informed about my order status.)

**Functional Requirements:**
- ...

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- ...

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ...

**Technology Stack Overview:**
- ...

**Flowchart (Mermaid.js):**

### 3. Ask AI to write the code

> Just combine sections #1 and #2 into a whole message and send it to the AI.

### 4. Ask AI to Summarize Completed Work

Please briefly summarize this project according to the following points:

1. **Project Requirements**: Provide a high-level overview of what we're building—goals, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.
2. **Application Workflow and Flowchart**: Step-by-step mapping of the user's journey and system interactions, illustrated with a clear flowchart.
3. **Tech Stack Overview**: Explanation of the technical choices—languages, frameworks, libraries, cloud services, tools, and version details, along with reasons for their selection.
4. **Frontend and Backend Guide**: Include coding standards, architecture patterns, folder structure, API protocol conventions, testing strategies, and styling rules separately for client-side and server-side.
5. **APIs, SDKs, and Technical References**: Consolidate all external dependencies—third-party APIs, SDKs, libraries, and platforms—with endpoints, version numbers, configuration examples, and quick start instructions.

### 5. AI-Generated Key Learning Points for Vibe Learning

I'm currently learning how to use AI for Vibe Coding through Vibe Learning. Here's an overview of Vibe Coding and Vibe Learning:

- **Vibe Coding**: A new coding approach where users, without any programming background, complete entire projects by leveraging AI capabilities.
- **Vibe Learning**: Focuses on mastering fundamental professional knowledge points, avoiding complex details, and clearly guiding AI to perform development tasks, allowing those unfamiliar with coding to develop projects.

My current professional background:
- No programming knowledge at all
- Unfamiliar with programming languages
- Almost no understanding of AI concepts
- Not familiar with Linux systems
- Never used GitHub
- Only basic proficiency in using Windows

According to the requirements of Vibe Learning and Vibe Coding, list the fundamental knowledge points I need to acquire to gain the following skills:
- Use professional language to issue development commands to AI
- Communicate with AI using professional terminology during the development process
- Assist AI in completing non-coding manual tasks
- Check and test tasks completed by AI, identifying or raising issues

This knowledge will enable me to comfortably use AI to complete the project.
