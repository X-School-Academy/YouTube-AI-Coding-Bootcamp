[中文版](README_zh_CN.md)

### Contents of the Course

1. [Introduction](01-introduction/README.md)

### **Background**

- **Vibe Coding**: An innovative approach to programming where users can complete entire coding projects without any prior programming experience by leveraging AI capabilities.
- **Vibe Learning**: [Vibe Learning Paper](https://github.com/X-School-Academy/Vibe-Learning-Reseach/blob/main/README.md) A learning method focused on mastering foundational concepts without diving into complicated details. Clear prompts guide AI to handle development tasks, enabling even those with no coding knowledge to build projects.

### **User Profile**

- Has absolutely no programming experience.
- Does not understand what programming languages are.
- Has minimal to no understanding of AI concepts.
- Possesses basic proficiency in using Windows.
- Unfamiliar with Linux systems.
- Has never used GitHub.

---

### **Development Environment**

- GitHub Codespaces (a Linux-based cloud development environment).

---

### **Project Goal**

Using "Vibe Coding," users will create a Python script in GitHub Codespaces that automatically generates videos by integrating OpenAI's text, speech, and image generation functionalities. The goal is to produce audiobook-style videos:

- Videos consist of multiple scenes, each containing text paired with corresponding voice narration.
- Content is dynamically generated based on user-provided prompts, suitable for children's stories, classical poetry, English learning materials, or other educational topics.

The final project will be presented through a web page interface. Users simply enter prompts into the webpage, the system displays real-time generation progress, and upon completion, the generated video can be played directly within the browser.

The entire process involves no programming tasks, allowing beginners with zero coding experience to bring their creative ideas to life and experience the creative empowerment facilitated by technology.
